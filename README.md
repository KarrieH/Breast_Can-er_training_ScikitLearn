# Breast_Canсer_training_ScikitLearn
Different algorithms of ML and hyperparameters customization (using Scikit-Learn)

# Description 
The aim of this notebook is to understand the process of choosing and applying the machine learning tools, comparing, selecting and improving the best models.

I analyze Breast Cancer dataset for classification in order to identify if the tumor is malignant or benign based on the cell features.
For this work I've chosen the logistic regression algorithm for classification. During the work i tried to tuning hyperparameter C with GridSearchCV, RandomGridSearch and fmin optimization.

For this analysis, as a guide  I use  "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists"
by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido.

Algorithms:
* Logistic Regression

For every algorithm was created personal file. There are exploring hyperparameters, cross validation and some characteristics of the model in this files.
