Different algorithms of ML and hyperparameters customization (using Scikit-Learn)

# Description 
The aim of this notebook is to understand the process of choosing and applying the machine learning tools, comparing, selecting and improving the best models.

I analyze machine learning algorithms for classification in order to identify if the tumor is malignant or benign based on the cell features.

For this analysis, as a guide  I use  "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists"
by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido.

Algorithms:

* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forests
* Neural Network
* SVM
